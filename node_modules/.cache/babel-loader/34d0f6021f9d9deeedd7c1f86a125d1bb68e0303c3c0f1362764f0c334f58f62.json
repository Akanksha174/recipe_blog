He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mind-set that has infected\",\n        book_url: \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511vJPN7p5L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\",\n        print_length: \"384 pages\",\n        language: \"English\",\n        author_name: \"Mark Manson\",\n        price: \"272\",\n    },\n    {\n        id: 10,\n        book_name: \"Ikigai\",\n        book_description: \"THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER We all have an ikigai.
